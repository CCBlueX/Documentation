## Global Settings Overview

LiquidBounce has a set of **global settings** that apply across the entire client, independent of any specific module. These settings control client-wide behavior such as target selection, Discord Rich Presence, the built-in client chat, auto-translation, blink packet management, and the command system prefix.

You can access global settings through the **ClickGUI** (default: **RIGHT SHIFT**) under the Settings section, or configure them using the `.value` command.
