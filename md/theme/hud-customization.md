### Basic HUD Configuration
While custom HUD components are not yet available, you can still customize your HUD in several ways:

1. **Moving Components**: You can move any HUD component to your desired position on the screen
2. **Toggling Elements**: Each HUD component can be individually toggled on or off
3. **Theme-based Appearance**: The look of your HUD components is determined by your selected [theme](docs/Theme%20System/Overview)

### HUD Editor
To access the HUD configuration screen:

1. Press the RIGHT SHIFT key to open the ClickGUI
2. Navigate to the HUD tab
3. Here you can drag components around and toggle them using the checkboxes
