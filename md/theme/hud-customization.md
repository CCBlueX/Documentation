From here, you can enable/disable components and adjust their positions.

### Use a different HUD look

The available HUD components and their look are determined by your active [theme](/docs/theme-system/overview). To change the appearance or add components, switch to a different theme from the [Marketplace](/docs/theme-system/overview#installing-themes-from-marketplace) or create your own following the [theme development guide](/docs/theme-system/overview#creating-your-own-theme).
