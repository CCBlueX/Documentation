## How to disable advertisements on LiquidLauncher

Donators may disable advertisements on the launcher entirely. If you have not donated yet, you can do so [here](https://liquidbounce.net/donate).

To disable the ads, follow these steps:

1. Create a [LiquidBounce account](https://user.liquidbounce.net/) and link your transfer code in the `Donator Cape` section. You can find the transfer code either on the website you were redirected to after your donation or in the confirmation email we sent you.
2. Run LiquidLauncher.
3. Press the cog icon in the upper right corner of the window to open the settings.
4. Switch to the `Donator` tab.
5. Press `Login with LiquidBounce account` and sign in in the browser window that opens.
6. Enable the `Skip advertisements` setting.
7. All ads should now be disabled!

2. Restart the launcher.
