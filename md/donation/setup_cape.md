### Instructions for LiquidBounce Nextgen (recommended)

2. Launch LiquidBounce.
3. Join a server or a singleplayer word.
4. Send `.client account login` into the chat.
5. A browser window should open. Login to your LiquidBounce account.
6. If everything went accordingly, you should now be logged in and your cape should be enabled. Make sure it says `Donation Perks: Yes` in the chat message.

### Instructions for LiquidBounce Legacy

1. Launch LiquidBounce.
2. In the main menu, press the button labeled `Alt Manager`.
3. To the right, press the button labeled `Cape`.
4. Enter your transfer code in the field called `Token` and press `Login`. You can find this token either on the website you were redirected to after your payment or in the confirmation email we sent you.
5. Login to an account using the alt manager.
6. Join a server and your cape should be visible.

### I can't see my cape!

There are many reasons why your cape might not be visible. Confirm the following:

1. Open Minecraft's skin settings and make sure `Cape` is enabled (main menu -> Options -> Skin Customization...).
2. Make sure you are logged into a premium Minecraft account. Capes will not work with offline accounts.
3. On Nextgen, make sure the `Cape Transfer` module is actually enabled.
4. If you are using legacy, make sure capes are enabled in the video settings.

If neither of these solved your problem try the following:

1. Login to your account again using the account manager.
2. Contact us via email ([support@liquidbounce.net](mailto:support@liquidbounce.net)) or [Discord](https://liquidbounce.net/discord).
