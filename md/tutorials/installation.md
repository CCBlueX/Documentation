## How to install LiquidBounce
**For most users, it is recommended to install LiquidBounce through our custom launcher instead of doing it manually. It takes the entire installation off your hands and will always automatically update to the latest LiquidBounce version in the future. You can get it from the [downloads page](https://liquidbounce.net/download).**

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of LiquidBounce. We assume that you already have Minecraft installed and are using the default Minecraft launcher. If the latter is not the case, certain steps of this tutorial may be slightly different for you. Below you will additionally find a video which covers everything described in this tutorial as well. However, keep in mind that the video only describes the installation of LiquidBounce 1.8.9. So if you want to install LiquidBounce 1.12.2 or one of the nightly versions for Fabric, you might be better off reading this tutorial.

LiquidBounce is a [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) client. This means that the installation procedure is very similar to that of regular Forge mods. Below we will also cover how you can install [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/home) to improve Minecraft's performance and benefit from additional graphical features such as shaders.

## Installing LiquidBounce with Forge
### LiquidBounce for Minecraft 1.8.9
1. [Download](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) and install the latest version of the Forge mod loader for Minecraft 1.8.9.
2. Open the Minecraft launcher, switch over to the `Installations` tab, hover over the profile created by the Forge installer and press the folder icon to the left of the `Play` button to open the Minecraft directory in your file explorer.
3. If there isn't a folder called `mods` already, create it.
4. [Download](https://liquidbounce.net/download) the latest version of LiquidBounce for Minecraft 1.8.9 and open it.
5. Extract the file called `LiquidBounce1.8.9.jar` to the `mods` folder.
6. Launch Forge by selecting the corresponding profile inside the launcher and pressing `Play`. If everything worked out, LiquidBounce should now be installed!

### LiquidBounce for Minecraft 1.12.2

### Installing OptiFine
Theoretically, the installation of OptiFine is optional but it's **highly** recommended to install it alongside LiquidBounce to improve performance. Simply follow these steps to install it.
1. Close Minecraft if it's still running.
2. [Download](https://optifine.net/downloads) the latest version of OptiFine for either Minecraft 1.8.9 or 1.12.2 respectively. (Press `Show all versions`.)
3. Copy the downloaded jar file to the same `mods` folder where you also placed the LiquidBounce jar file.
4. Launch Forge again. To make sure, OptiFine is installed properly, go into the video settings screen and verify that it says `OptiFine` in the bottom left corner.

## Installing LiquidBounce next-gen preview versions
At the moment we are working on a completely new version of LiquidBounce for Minecraft 1.8.9 - 1.16.5 which is no longer built around Forge but the [Fabric modding API](https://fabricmc.net/). It is still in early development so bugs are common and many features are still missing. If you want to give it a try already, you can install it by following these steps. **Only use this version if you know what you are doing!**
1. [Download](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and install the latest version of the Fabric mod loader for Minecraft 1.16.5.
2. Open the Minecraft launcher, switch over to the `Installations` tab, hover over the profile created by the Fabric installer and press the folder icon to the left of the `Play` button to open the Minecraft directory in your file explorer.
3. If there isn't a folder called `mods` already, create it.
4. [Download](https://liquidbounce.net/download) the latest nighly build of LiquidBounce next-gen and open it.
5. Extract the jar file from the archive to the `mods` folder.
6. [Download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin) the latest version of the Fabric Language Kotlin mod for Minecraft 1.16.5 and place it in the `mods` folder as well.
7. Launch Fabric by selecting the corresponding profile inside the launcher and pressing `Play`. If everything worked out, LiquidBounce should now be installed!
