## How to install LiquidBounce scripts
LiquidBounce provides an interface that allows third-party developers from our community to enhance the client with new features. This interface is used by so-called scripts, which are written in JavaScript. If you would like to learn more about the technical aspects of this feature or to develop your own scripts, the documentation will help you. This tutorial only covers the installation of already existing scripts.

There are essentially two ways to install a script. Both are outlined below, with the first method being recommended for newcomers.

### Method 1: Using the import feature
LiquidBounce has a simple functionality that allows you to import single script files as well as whole zip archives with numerous files. Please make sure that your game is **not** in full screen mode during the following process.
1. Find a script that you want to install. If you don't know where to get scripts from, take a look at [this page](https://liquidbounce.net/scripts/) or the respective category in our [forum](https://forums.ccbluex.net/category/9/scripts).
2. Launch LiquidBounce.
3. In the main menu first press on `Mods` and then on `Scripts`. This menu lists all installed scripts including name, author and current version number.
4. Select the file you want to import in the file dialog. Single scripts as well as whole zip archives can be imported. If no errors have occurred, the script should now also be listed.
5. It is recommended that you restart the client now to ensure that the script is fully loaded and no unforeseen problems arise.

That's it! The script should now be fully installed.

### Method 2: Manual installation
It is also possible to install scripts manually by copying them into their designated folder. This method is recommended if you already know a bit about the installation process and want to shorten it.
1. Open the Scripts folder. It is located in the LiquidBounce directory, which in turn is located in the Minecraft directory by default. If you use the default launcher, you can usually find it at `%appdata%/.minecraft` on Windows. If you use our LiquidLauncher instead, you can find it at `%appdata%/.LiquidLauncher/gameDir`.
2. Copy the script file you want to install into this folder. If it is a zip file, extract it first.
3. Launch LiquidBounce.
4. Navigate to the script manager screen and make sure the script has been loaded sucessfully.
