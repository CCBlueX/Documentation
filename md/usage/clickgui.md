# Using the ClickGUI

The **ClickGUI** is LiquidBounce's main interface for enabling, disabling and configuring modules. You can use it both from the main menu and while you are in a world.

## Opening the ClickGUI

You can open the ClickGUI in two ways:

- **In‑game**: Press **RIGHT SHIFT** (default keybind).
- **From the Title screen**: Click **LiquidBounce → ClickGUI**.

Once opened, the game world is blurred in the background and the ClickGUI panels appear on top.

## Layout and Categories

The ClickGUI is organized into **categories**, each containing a list of modules:

- **Combat** – Combat hacks (for example Kill Aura).
- **Movement** – Movement hacks (for example Fly, Speed).
- **Player** – Player cheats and utilities (for example Chest Stealer, Eagle).
- **Render** – Visual hacks (for example ESPs and other overlays).
- **World** – World interaction and automation hacks (for example Auto Farm).
- **Client** – Client‑side hacks and utilities that affect the client itself.
- **Misc** – Miscellaneous hacks and features that don’t fit other categories.
- **Exploit** – Exploit‑focused hacks that abuse server or protocol behavior.

Each category appears as its own panel. You can scroll inside panels to see more modules and drag panels to reposition them.

## Searching for Modules

When using the search bar:

- Type the name of a module (for example `Kill Aura`).
- Optionally use the **arrow keys** to move through the results; press **ENTER** to toggle the selected module.
- **Left‑click** on a search result toggles the module.
- **Right‑click** on a search result opens the **corresponding category panel** and scrolls it so the module is visible.

## Toggling Modules

There are two common ways to toggle modules:

1. **From the category panel**
   - Locate a module in its category panel.
   - **Left‑click** the module entry to **enable/disable** it.

2. **From the search bar results**
   - Type part of the module name.
   - **Left‑click** the matching entry to toggle it directly.

Enabled modules are highlighted so you can see which hacks are currently active.

## Opening Module Settings

Most modules have additional settings such as modes, ranges or keybinds. To open these settings:

1. Find the module in its **category panel** (you can use the search bar and then right‑click the result to jump to it).
2. **Right‑click** the module entry.
3. A detailed **settings view** for that module opens.

In the settings view you can typically:

- Change the **bind** (key used to toggle the module without opening ClickGUI).
- Enable **Hidden** if you want the module not to show in the HUD Array List.
- Adjust **sliders** (for example range, speed, delay).
- Toggle additional **options** and **sub‑features**.

When you are done configuring, you can simply close the settings view by right clicking the module again; your changes are saved automatically.

## Closing the ClickGUI

To close the ClickGUI:

- Press **ESC**.

Once closed, you are back in the game or main menu with your configured hacks.
