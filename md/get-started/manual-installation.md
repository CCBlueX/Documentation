# How to install LiquidBounce manually

This tutorial will guide you through the manual installation of LiquidBounce. We assume that you already have Minecraft installed and are using the official Minecraft launcher made by Mojang. If the latter is not the case, certain steps of this tutorial may differ slightly for you.

LiquidBounce Nextgen is our most recent client with active development. It is based on 1.21.4, but compatible with all Minecraft versions and features a modern user interface, improved performance and enhanced modules. To install it manually, follow the instructions below.

1. [Download](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and install the latest version of the Fabric mod loader on your system.
2. Run the Minecraft launcher, switch to the *Installations* tab, hover over the profile the Fabric installer just created and press the directory icon that appeared to the right of the button labeled *Play*. This will open the Minecraft installation directory in your file explorer.
3. If you do not see a folder called *mods*, create it.
4. [Download](/download) the the latest version of LiquidBounce nextgen found under the section labeled *Manual Installation* (Press *Show nightly builds* to see pre-releases).
5. Extract the jar file from the archive you just downloaded to the *mods* directory.
6. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/) and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) and place them in the *mods* directory as well.
7. Launch Fabric by selecting the corresponding profile inside the launcher and pressing Play. If everything worked out, LiquidBounce should now be installed!

### Installing recommended mods

The following list contains various mods we highly recommend installing alongside LiquidBounce. They can be installed by simply downloading them and copying them to the mods folder just like you did with LiquidBounce itself.

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) to massively improve performance.
- [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) allows you to connect to all servers running Minecraft 1.7 and above.
- [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/versions) to prevent other players from reporting your chat messages.
