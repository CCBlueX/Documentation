## CustomHUD
LiquidBounce allows you to configure the HUD of the client entirely according to your preferences. To accomplish this, the client provides a unique feature called CustomHUD. It can be accessed by opening the ClickGUI (bound to RSHIFT by default) and then clicking the blue button with brush on it in the lower left corner of the screen.

From this menu you can now make the desired changes to the HUD. It is possible to rearrange existing components or to add completely new ones.
#### Adjust existing elements
To make changes to an already existing element, simply click on it. You can then change various parameters in the editor window, which can alter the appearance or function of the selected element. 
#### Add new element
If you want to add a new element instead, first click in an empty space to make sure that no other element is selected. Now click on 'Create Element' and select one from the list of available components. It should now show up on the screen. 
#### Delete an element
If you want to delete an element, first select it by clicking on it and then click on 'Delete' in the editor window.
