    };

    /* 'getAliases()' can be used to define alias names for a command. '.testCommand' and '.demoCommand' 
    execute the same code as '.exampleCommand'. */
    this.getAliases = function() {
        return ["testCommand", "demoCommand"];
    };

    /* 'execute()' contains the actual code of the command. It is being executed once the sent the command. 
    args contains the arguments the user passed to the command. args[0] is the command name. */

        mc.thePlayer.jump();
