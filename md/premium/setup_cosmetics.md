### Instructions for LiquidBounce Legacy

**Note:** LiquidBounce Legacy only supports capes. Other premium cosmetics like Deadmau5 ears are only available in LiquidBounce Nextgen.

1. Launch LiquidBounce.
2. In the main menu, press the button labeled `Alt Manager`.
3. To the right, press the button labeled `Cape`.
4. Enter your transfer code in the field called `Token` and press `Login`. You can find this token either on the website you were redirected to after your payment or in the confirmation email we sent you.
5. Login to an account using the alt manager.
6. Join a server and your cape should be visible.

### I can't see my cosmetics!

There are many reasons why your cosmetics might not be visible. Confirm the following:

1. Open Minecraft's skin settings and make sure `Cape` is enabled (main menu -> Options -> Skin Customization...).
2. Make sure you are logged into a premium Minecraft account. Cosmetics will not work with offline accounts.

If neither of these solved your problem try the following:

1. Login to your account again using the account manager.
2. Contact us via our [contact page](https://ccbluex.net/contact) or [Discord](https://liquidbounce.net/discord).
